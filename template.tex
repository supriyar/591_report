\begin{abstract}
This document is intended to serve as a sample for submissions to MICRO 2013.
We provide some guidelines that authors should follow when submitting papers to
the conference.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

This document provides the formatting instructions for submissions to the 46th
Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture,
2013~\cite{micro46}. In an effort to respect the efforts of reviewers and in
the interest of fairness to all prospective authors, we request that all
submissions to MICRO-46 follow the formatting and submission rules detailed
below.  Submissions that (grossly) violate these instructions may not be
reviewed, at the discretion of the program chair, in order to maintain a review
process that is fair to all potential authors.

An example submission (formatted using the MICRO-46 submission format) that
contains the submission and formatting guidelines can be downloaded from here:
\href{http://www.microarch.org/micro46/files/micro46-template.pdf}{Sample
PDF}. The contents of this document are the same as the contents of the
submission instructions that appear on
\href{http://www.microarch.org/micro46/submission.html}{this website}.

All questions regarding paper formatting and submission should be directed to
the program chair.

\section{Preparation Instructions}

\subsection{Paper Formatting} 

All submissions should contain a maximum of 12 pages of single-spaced
two-column text. If you are using \LaTeX~to typeset your paper, then we suggest
that you use the template available here:
\href{http://www.microarch.org/micro46/files/micro46-latex-template.tar.gz}{\LaTeX~Template}.
(\href{http://www.microarch.org/micro46/files/micro46-template.pdf}{This
document} was prepared with that template.)  If you are using a different
software package to typeset your paper, then please adhere to the guidelines
mentioned in Table~\ref{table:formatting}.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Field} & \textbf{Value}\\
    \hline
    \hline
    Page limit & 12 pages\\
    \hline
    Paper size & US Letter 8.5in $\times$ 11in\\

\end{table}

\textbf{Please ensure that you include page numbers with your
submission}. This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to
different parts of your paper when they provide comments.

\subsection{Content}

\noindent\textbf{\sout{Author List.}} All submissions are double
blind. Therefore, please do not include any author names in the
submission. You must also ensure that the metadata included in the
PDF does not give away the authors. If you are improving upon your
prior work, refer to your prior work as a third person and include
references to your past work. 

\noindent\textbf{Figures and Tables.} Ensure that the figures and
tables are legible.  Please also ensure that you refer to your
figures in the main text. Many reviewers print the papers in
gray-scale. Therefore, if you use colors for your figures, ensure
that the different colors are distinguishable in gray-scale.

\noindent\textbf{Main Body.} Avoid bad page or column breaks in
your main text, i.e., last line of a paragraph at the top of a
column or first line of a paragraph at the end of a column. If you
begin a new section or sub-section near the end of a column,
ensure that you have at least 2 lines of body text on the same
column. 

\section{Documents to be Uploaded to the Submissions Site}

In addition to your paper, you can optionally upload past reviews and
author response to past reviews for this submission (PDF file). This
document will be used at the discretion of the program chair during
the review process.

Specifically, authors can submit a PDF file that includes any
combination of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item what conference(s) this paper was previously submitted to, if any,
\item the past reviews received for the paper from the review process in those conferences,
\item how the submission has addressed the past reviews,
\item how the submission has improved upon the previously submitted versions of the paper.
\end{itemize}

This furnished information \textbf{may} be used at the discretion of
the program chair only after the paper rebuttal period and during the
program committee meeting (see below for more information). We
encourage the authors to provide this information especially if they
would like to 1) respond to past reviews and did not feel they got a
chance to do so, 2) proactively address potential concerns about the
paper that are similar to concerns in past reviews that get brought up
after the paper rebuttal period and during the program committee
meeting.

Note: Your submission will still undergo a full new review process
that is independent of this PDF file you submit. MICRO-46 reviewers
will complete their reviews independently of this PDF file, and will
not see this PDF file until after the paper rebuttal period ends. The
sole purpose of asking for this PDF file is to provide the authors a
chance to rebut potential reviewer concerns that could arise during
the paper discussion period and the program committee meeting that
happens after the MICRO-46 rebuttal period ends.

% Authors can potentially include: proofs of theorems, more details on
% methodology, more results, and anything else that can potentially answer
% reviewer questions.  You can reference the appendix from your paper, but do not
% assume it will be read.

% \subsection{Optional Past Reviews and Author Responses}


\section{Submission Instructions}

\subsection{Paper Authors}

Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors once
the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program chair.

\subsection{Conflict Responsibilities}

The authors should register all their conflicts into the paper reviewing site.
Conflicts are needed to resolve assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to
have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem, the paper may be rejected.

Please declare a conflict of interest with the following for any author of a paper:

\begin{enumerate}
\item PhD advisor
\item Other past or current advisors
\item Current or past students
\item People with the same affiliation
\item People whom you co-authored papers with in the last 5 years
\item People whom you co-authored funded proposals with in the last 5 years.
\end{enumerate}

There may be others with whom you know a conflict of interest exists.  However,
you will need to justify this conflict of interest.  Please be reasonable.  For
example, just because a reviewer works on similar topics as the paper you are
submitting is on, you cannot declare a conflict of interest with
them. We will carefully check the justification of conflicts and take
action when authors seem to be blacklisting reviewers without
sufficient justification. 

You will have to declare all conflicts with PC members as well as
non-PC members that may serve as external reviewers with whom you
have a conflict of interest. When in doubt, contact the program chair.


\subsection{Concurrent Submissions and Resubmissions of Already Published Papers}

By submitting a manuscript to MICRO-46, the authors guarantee that the
manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for
publication in a substantially similar form in any conference or
journal. The authors also guarantee that no paper which contains
significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper is
under review to any other conference or journal or workshop, or will
be submitted to one of them during the MICRO-46 review
period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.

Extended versions of papers accepted to IEEE Computer Architecture
Letters can be submitted to MICRO-46.  If you are in doubt, contact
the program chair.
