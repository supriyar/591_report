%Processors with 10s of cores~\cite{amdopteron, azulvega3, cavimoctnet,
%intelxeon, TILE-Gx100} are already available commercially.  A
%packet-based on-chip network  with a regular topology is  an
%attractive solution for connecting these large number of cores and the
%associated on-chip structures, as they are scalable with predictable
%electrical properties~\cite{route-packets}. An efficient on-chip
%network design could have a significant impact on a many-core
%processor's performance and power consumption.
