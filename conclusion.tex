In this paper, we incorporated compiler based static information and DDMS based dynamic statistics to formulate two heuristics for intelligent scheduling of thread migration on COMET. COMET offloads threads to a remote server when the time of execution of non-native code exceeds the threshold (based on sync time and RTT). Although, the authors have shown considerable performance improvement in the execution time of applications that benefit from increased computation power, the scheduling fails to take into account the application characteristics. These characteristics sometimes cause the offloaded thread to abort and return soon after the thread is migrated. The communication overhead involved degrades the overall performance of the application. Secondly, since the offloading procedure waits for the threshold to be achieved on the client before offloading, COMET loses the opportunity the offload when it could have, thereby not utilizing the compute resources to the fullest.
Both our offloading heuristics are aimed at addressing these limitations. By analyzing the applications we identified the application characteristics with respect its native method calls. Both heuristics can be used in conjunction to enhance the application performance.
