Mobile code offloading strategies are arising as a prominent domain as it improves the performance of
applications by perfoming most of the computation in the could. While this strategy is feasible for most
applications, there are many important factors that need to be considered before offloading applications
to a remote host. In this report, we propose certain enchancements to the scheduling mechanisms of COMET,
a DSM based offloading infrastructure. COMET mainly focuses on how to offload rather than what to offload.
Offloading decisions are an important factor as it varies based on network parameters and the execution
profiles of applications.

Our scheduling heuristics use static and dynamic profiling to determine scheduling decisions around native
methods. In addition, we also factor in the current network bandwidth to disable offloading when the network
conditions are poor. We evaluate our proposed heuristics on select android applications and compare the
performance with the COMET baseline offloading heuristic.
